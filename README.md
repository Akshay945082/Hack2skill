Project assinged for interview 

1. Web Scraping Task:

You are required to complete a web scraping task using Python. The task involves extracting data from a B2B directory website. You can find the detailed instructions in the question below:

Web Scraping Question: Using Python, write a script to scrape data from a B2B directory website (e.g., Yellow Pages, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, or any other similar platform) to collect information about companies in a specific industry category of your choice (e.g., "IT Services," "Manufacturing," "Digital Marketing Agencies," etc.).

Your task is to extract the following details for at least 30-50 companies from the first 2-3 pages of search results:

Company Name

Website URL

Contact Number

Location/Address

Industry/Category

Company Description (if available)

Email Address

Store the extracted data in a CSV file with appropriate column headers. Ensure you handle potential errors, missing data, and HTTP issues gracefully, and make your script efficient by avoiding getting blocked (e.g., using delays between requests). This task will only be accepted if completed using a Python script.
